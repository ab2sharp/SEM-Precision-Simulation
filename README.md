# SEM-simulation
Simulation comparing precision of different estimation approaches within SEM


# Files

The file `semRB_functions.R` contains the functions that you need to run the simulation.

The file `simpara__semRB_(nobs-p-iters).R` contains the code for running the simulation itself. 

The file `semRB_simulation.sh` contains all of parameter specifications used to create the boxplots.

The file `rbboxplots_tx.eps` contains the plotted results. 

The files `xyzv3.RData` contain the results of running the simulation, where `x=nobs`, `y=parameter dimension` and `z=chain length`. These are the files required to plot the data.
